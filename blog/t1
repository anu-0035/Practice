There is a old saying "What we give is what we get". The same goes with our relationship with the environment.
We take everyday needs from the world around us , water, food, fuel, land. This are the essential thing that suatain us,
but the question is what are we giving in return. 

The uncomfortable truth is that , for the most part , we are not giving as much as we are takin.
The natural balanace,was once renewed , is now heavily skewed.Our demand has exponentialy increased and 
while our contribution to our enviornment is dwinled.

We have created a cycle of taking and taking and there is not return in between.Forest are cleared, oceans polluted, 
glaciour are melting, air thickened with emmison and the land is scarred by mining and drilling.
The environment, which once abundant and self-sustaing , is strugggin under the weight of our relentless consuption.
